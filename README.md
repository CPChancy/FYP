This is the project that I developed as part of my final year dissertation at Nottingham Trent University.

It is a proof of concept of a training tool used to educate and aid in industry workers on data safety and security
in a palateable and understandable format and way.

The target audience of this designed project included individuals from SMEs with minimal IT training or understanding.
